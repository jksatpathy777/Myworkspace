    The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    The hr tag element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
    
    <br>
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr> 
<br><br>
The br tag used in a paragraph means a Line Break-
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
   
Problem in writing a poem as below shows in single line -
<p>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  </p>
<br>
Solution for this  is using pre tag-  
<pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  </pre>
